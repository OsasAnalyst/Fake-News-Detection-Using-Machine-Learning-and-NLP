# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and NLP

## Executive Summary  

In today's digital age, the rapid spread of misinformation and fake news has become a significant threat to media integrity and public trust. Social media platforms, blogs, and online news sites often distribute misleading articles, influencing public opinion and decision-making.  

To address this challenge, **Veritas Media Solutions**, a media organization committed to journalistic integrity, has initiated a **Fake News Detection System** powered by **Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This system is designed to automatically classify news articles as **fake or true** based on their textual content.  

By leveraging **text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models**, this solution aims to assist journalists, media analysts, and fact-checking organizations in verifying the credibility of online content. The outcome of this project will be an **automated, scalable, and data-driven approach** to detecting misinformation, ensuring that the public receives accurate and trustworthy news.

## Data Collection  

The dataset for this project is sourced from **Kaggle’s Fake News Detection Dataset** ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets)). It consists of two CSV files:  

- **Fake.csv** – Contains fabricated news articles.  
- **True.csv** – Contains verified and authentic news articles.  

### **Dataset Details:**  
| Feature  | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `title`  | Headline of the news article (removed for analysis) |
| `text`   | Main body of the news article (used for NLP processing) |
| `subject` | Category of the news article (removed for analysis) |
| `date`   | Publication date (removed for analysis) |
| `label`  | **1 for Fake News**, **0 for True News** (manually added) |

### **Data Preprocessing Steps:**  
1. **Load the dataset** from Kaggle into **Google Colab** using Kaggle’s API.  
2. **Drop unnecessary columns** (`title`, `subject`, `date`) to focus on textual content.  
3. **Clean and preprocess text** using NLP techniques such as **lemmatization, stopword removal, and tokenization**.  
4. **Convert text into numerical format** using **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction.  
5. **Split the dataset** into training and testing sets (80/20 split).  

This well-structured dataset provides a strong foundation for building an **accurate and scalable fake news detection system** that can be used by media professionals, fact-checkers, and policymakers.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

I **removed unnecessary columns (`title`, `subject`, `date`)** to focus on textual content and checked for missing values.  

### **Data Distribution & Labeling**  
- **Fake news was labeled as `1`**  
- **True news was labeled as `0`**  

For balanced training, we **sampled 5000 articles from each category** and combined them into a single dataset.

## **Modeling Approach**  

### **Text Preprocessing**  
To enhance the quality of text features, we applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**:  
1. **Lemmatization** – Reducing words to their root forms using `SpaCy`.  
2. **Stopword & Punctuation Removal** – Filtering out common stopwords to retain meaningful words.

### **Feature Extraction**  
I converted textual data into numerical form using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization. This transformation allowed the machine learning model to interpret the textual content as numerical features.  

### **Model Selection & Training**  
I used a **Random Forest Classifier**, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, due to its ability to handle high-dimensional text data effectively.  

**Pipeline Approach:**  
- **Step 1:** Convert text into numerical features using `TfidfVectorizer()`.  
- **Step 2:** Train the model using `RandomForestClassifier()`.  

The dataset was splitted into **80% training** and **20% testing** to evaluate model generalization.

## **Model Evaluation**  

### **1.1 Model Performance Metrics**  
The trained model achieved an **accuracy of 99.80%** on the test dataset.  

#### **Classification Report:**

| Recall          | 1.00  |
| F1-Score       | 1.00  |

### **Confusion Matrix Visualization**  
To understand the model's classification performance, we plotted a **confusion matrix** using `Seaborn`.

Interpretation:  
- High **true positive** and **true negative** rates indicate the model effectively differentiates between fake and true news.

## **Limitations**  

1. **Limited Dataset:** The model was trained on a fixed dataset and may not generalize well to news articles written in different **styles, languages, or formats**.   
2. **Potential Bias:** If the dataset contains **biased labeling**, the model might inherit and reinforce these biases.  
3. **Not Robust to Evolving Fake News Techniques:** Fake news strategies evolve over time, requiring **continuous retraining** of the model.

   - Collect **real-world fake news data** from various platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, fact-checking websites).  

3. **Develop a Web-Based Fake News Detection Tool**  
   - Create a user-friendly **dashboard or web app** where journalists and users can input news articles for instant verification.  

4. **Model Optimization & Fine-Tuning**
